As manifestos go, you can’t get any simpler than the Golden Rule. So fundamental is it, that it’s the basis for modern human rights.

I was first introduced to the Golden Rule in catechism when I was a child.  Considered the center of Christian ethics, and attributed to Jesus from his Sermon on the Mount, (says Matthew), it was about the only thing I remembered from those religion classes, which, as it turned out, was the point. The next time I discussed the Golden Rule was in a philosophy class. The professor told us that if we couldn’t remember anything else from the class, if we had no personal manifesto, no moral compass, or were perhaps sociopaths and didn’t know how to act in public, the good news was that we only had to remember this one rule.

The Golden Rule exists, if Wikipedia can be trusted, in every religion and ethical code, including those predating Christianity. Imagine if modern society could live up to this one rule (or any version of it):

"That which you hate to be done to you, do not do to another." –Ancient Egypt
 
"Do not do to others what you know has hurt yourself" –Ancient India

"Avoid doing what you would blame others for doing." –Ancient Greece

"Whatever is disagreeable to yourself do not do unto others." –Ancient Persia
 
"Treat your inferior as you would wish your superior to treat you." –Ancient Rome
 
"What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others." –Confucianism
 
“You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your kinsfolk. Love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.” –Judiasm
 
Do to others what you want them to do to you. This is the meaning of the law of Moses and the teaching of the prophets. –Christianity
 
"Pay, Oh Children of Adam, as you would love to be paid, and be just as you would love to have justice!" –Islam
 
“One should never do that to another which one regards as injurious to one’s own self. This, in brief, is the rule of dharma. Other behavior is due to selfish desires.” –Hinduism
 
“Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful.” –Buddhism
 
“A man should wander about treating all creatures as he himself would be treated.” –Jainism
