One of the first moments I had as a thoughtful person came toward the end of my first reading of James Joyce’s “A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.” At the time, I was a young man, introverted and isolated, and as it happens the book is about an introspective boy trying to figure out what he’ll stand for as a man. So there’s that.

Somewhere in the last few pages, the main character, Stephen Dedalus, is talking to his humanitarian friend, Cranly, who has a “priestlike face”. In these pages, Cranly questions Stephen about his beliefs. Half annoyed and half inspired, Stephen confesses, in what I call, a personal manifesto. This manifesto felt so right to me that I copied into the cover of all my school notebooks for years afterward. Of course, the book has been around since 1916, so it perhaps was already a cliché and a tad pretentious to adopt it, but it serves as an example of what I mean by manifestos and our natural tendency to try and figure ourselves out.

>“ __Look here, Cranly, he said. You have asked me what I would and would not do. I will tell you what I will do and what I will not do. I will not serve that in which I no longer believe whether it call itself my home, my fatherland or my church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use—silence, exile, and cunning.”
